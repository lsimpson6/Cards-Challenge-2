ABOUT THE SITE
--------------

To create the grid I utalized the flex style to create the rows and transition to columns based on the screen size. Each of the gradient images has a CSS WebKit Animation to give the impression of a card flipping to see the reverse side of it. The plus(+) sign has a WebKit Animation as well to spin the button when the user would like to add something to the site with the button taking the user to a webpage of href="#" for design and testing purposes. 

All of the images on the site such as the gradient image, button image, and footer shapes were designed on illustrator and exported as a .svg file for better optimazion and increased web speed.
